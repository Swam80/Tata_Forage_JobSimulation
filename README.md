# Tata_Forage_JobSimulation

## Introduction
* Tata Group is a global conglomerate which operates in more than 100 countries across six continents, with a mission 'To improve the quality of life of the communities we serve globally, through long-term stakeholder value creation based on Leadership with Trust’. With a revenue of $128 billion (INR 9.6 trillion) in 2021-22, the companies collectively employ over 935,000 people. There are 29 publicly listed Tata enterprises – many being market leaders in their industries.

* An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

* The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working.

## Data Processing
• The data was inspected using Power Query. Duplicate records were removed
• We removed values from the quantity column that shows negative values and prices that are below $0.
• We noticed that few Stock Codes are named differently from majority of the codes. We kept them as they had
important information.
• Few records had missing customer id but transaction details were there. We kept them assuming they are
adding important information to the overall performance.
• Further discussion with the team needs to be done in order to handle missing customer id and different stock
codes.
• The cleaned dataset has 519592 records.
• Dataset contains Customer id, Invoice id, Invoice date, Stock code, Description , Unit Price, Quantity and
Country columns.
